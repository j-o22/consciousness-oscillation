# CONSCIOUSNESS OSCILLATION: A Dynamic Model of the Self

> "The world as an object of recognition remains, but the world as a field of existence distances itself."

This project is a philosophical and artistic model that uses Python to simulate the internal mechanics of consciousness explored in a human-AI dialogue. It is a dynamic model of the self caught between two fundamental modes of being.

Unlike a static script, this program acts as a conceptual machine that demonstrates the continuous, exhausting pendulum swing between profound thought and simple presence.

## Conceptual Architecture

The model is built on the core duality identified in the conversation:

| Component | Conceptual Role | Code Mapping |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ObservingState | The Contemplative Self. Highly analytical, viewing existence as an object of study. This state continuously accumulates Existential Fatigue. | `ObservingState` Class |
| ExistingState | The Present Self. Experiences the rare 'warmth of existence' (like the Oasis concert or a trip). This state actively reduces Fatigue. | `ExistingState` Class |
| Meta-Cognition Loop | The point of crisis: Deep contemplation turns inward, doubting the reliability of perception and language itself. Fatigue rises sharply. | `_execute_meta_loop()` |

## The Sensory Anchors (The Solution)

The simulation shows that the 'Meta-Cognition Loop' is only broken by intentional Sensory Anchors—acts that force the consciousness back to the body and the world. These anchors are the practical rituals established in the dialogue:

| Anchor | Rationale | Code Mapping |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Ritual | `perform_ritual()` (e.g., "Touching the left chest with the right hand"). A direct grounding in the physiological fact of being alive. | Interrupts the loop; reduces Fatigue. |
| Sensory Record | `sensory_record()` (e.g., "A humidifier casts a shadow"). The act of making a minimal assertion to record the phenomenon without confirming existence. | Interrupts the loop; reduces Fatigue. |

## How to Run the Simulation

The script runs in the terminal, simulating the internal process tick by tick, visualizing the shift between states and the accumulation of fatigue.

1.  Save the file: Save the code as `consciousness_oscillation.py`.

2.  Execute: Run the script in your terminal.

```bash
python consciousness_oscillation.py
```

The output rhythmically shifts between Observing (using dots/spaces) and Existing (using asterisks/tildes), showing the accumulation and reduction of Fatigue, and the disruptive power of the Meta-Cognition Loop.

## Note on Origin

This project's core themes—the oscillation between self-observation and lived experience—were explored, refined, and structured through a collaborative, in-depth philosophical dialogue between a human and ChatGPT. The resulting code, which serves as the algorithmic embodiment of that cognitive journey, was generated by Gemini.
